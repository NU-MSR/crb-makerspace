- Always use eye protection.
- Request the key from the lab manager and unlock the device.
- Select the appropriate drill bit for your material and hole size. Insert the bit into the chuck and tighten securely using the chuck key. **Remove the chuck key immediately after use and store it safely.**
- Adjust the table height so the workpiece will be at a comfortable working height. Lock the table in place.
- Secure your workpiece firmly to the table using clamps or a vise. **Never hold the workpiece by hand.**
- Adjust the speed if needed (slower speeds for larger bits and harder materials, faster speeds for smaller bits and softer materials).
- If you need to limit the drilling depth, mark the depth with tape on the drill bit (no depth stop available).
- Turn on the drill press and allow it to reach full speed.
- Lower the quill slowly and steadily using the feed handle. Apply consistent, moderate pressure—let the bit do the cutting.
- For deep holes, periodically retract the bit to clear chips and allow the bit to cool.
- When finished, retract the quill fully and turn off the machine.
- Wait for the machine to come to a complete stop before touching the workpiece or tool.
- Remove the drill bit using the chuck key, and return the drill bit to its storage location.
- Return the key to the lab manager.
- Clean up your workspace.
