!!! warning

    - Risk of severe entanglement with rotating workpiece or chuck
    - Flying chips and metal shavings can be hot and sharp
    - Risk of ejection of improperly secured workpiece
    - Risk of cuts from sharp tools and workpiece edges
    - Chuck key left in chuck becomes projectile

## Safety

- Understand the operation of the machine before use. If you are unsure, ask for help—do not “see what happens.”
- Always wear safety glasses and appropriate clothing; no rings, gloves, neckties, jewelry, or loose-fitting garments. Tie back long hair.
- Make sure all guards are in place and the area is clean and uncluttered before operating the lathe.
- Secure the workpiece properly in the chuck or other workholding device. **Do not use unbalanced or poorly held workpieces.**
- Remove all tools (wrenches, chuck keys, locking pins, etc.) from the spindle immediately after using them.
- Keep hands, clothing, and tools away from the rotating chuck and workpiece. Avoid pinch points.
- Stop the spindle and allow it to come to a complete stop before reaching into the work area, changing tools, adjusting workpieces, or clearing chips.
- Clear chips with a brush or other tool, never with your hands or with compressed air.
- Use appropriate cutting tools with appropriate feeds and speeds. Do not force or overload the machine.
- Never leave the lathe running unattended.

## Instructions for use

!!! info

- Verify you are authorized to use the lathe and have completed machine-specific training.
- Inspect the machine for damage or abnormal wear. Make sure guards are in place and the area around the lathe is clear.
- Choose an appropriate workholding method (3-jaw chuck, collet, or other approved fixture) for your part. Mount the workpiece and tighten securely; rotate the chuck by hand to check for clearance.
- Select the appropriate cutting tool and ensure it is sharp and correctly mounted in the tool post at or near center height.
- Remove the chuck key and any wrenches from the spindle and tool post. **Never leave a chuck key in the chuck.**
- Use the **Cutting Speeds** table and calculator below to select an appropriate spindle speed for your material and operation. Set the speed on the lathe.
- With the spindle off, bring the tool close to the workpiece and “touch off” as needed to establish your zero reference.
- Start the spindle and allow it to reach full speed before feeding the tool into the workpiece.
- Use the carriage and cross slide to feed the tool smoothly. Take light cuts, especially on unknown materials or setups, and listen for chatter or signs of overload.
- For long chips, periodically stop and clear chips with a brush; do not reach near the rotating workpiece.
- When finished, retract the tool, stop the spindle, and wait for it to come to a complete stop before measuring or removing the part.
- Remove the workpiece and cutting tools, deburr sharp edges, and brush/vacuum chips from the machine and surrounding area.
- Return the key and any accessories to their storage locations and leave the lathe clean for the next user.

## Cutting Speeds

Turning speeds are adjusted to the feed rate of the mini lathe (0.004/rev.), a depth of cut of 0.040, and a tool life of 180 minutes.
