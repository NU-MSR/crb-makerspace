!!! warning

    - Risk of cuts from contact with rotating cutting tools
    - Flying chips and metal shavings can be hot and sharp
    - Risk of workpiece or tool ejection if improperly secured
    - Pinch points between moving table and fixed components
    - Chuck key left in chuck becomes projectile

## Safety

- Always wear safety glasses that are ANSI Z87.1 compliant.
- Wear appropriate clothing; no rings, gloves, neckties, jewelry, or loose-fitting garments. Tie back long hair.
- Make sure you understand the operation of the machine before use. If you are unsure, ask for help—do not “see what happens.”
- Remove all tools (wrenches, chuck keys, etc.) from the spindle and table before turning on the machine.
- Secure the workpiece with a vise. **Make sure the workpiece is held tightly.**
- Keep hands away from the rotating spindle, cutter, and moving table. Avoid pinch points between the table and fixed parts of the mill.
- Clear chips with a brush or vacuum only. **Do not use your hands or compressed air** to remove chips.
- Inspect cutting tools for damage before use and replace dull or chipped tools.
- Do not attempt cuts that exceed the capacity of the mini mill or that you have not been trained to perform.
- Never leave the machine running unattended.

## Instructions for use

!!! info
    
    Use of this tool requires permission from management and a key to operate. Check out the key from Raphael or authorized personnel before use and return it immediately after.

!!! failure "Do not cut steel in the CRB Makerspace"

- Verify you are authorized to use the mill and have completed machine-specific training.
- Secure your workpiece in the vise or with clamps on the table. Ensure it is flat and cannot shift under cutting forces.
- Select an appropriate cutter (e.g., end mill or drill) or tool (e.g. edge or center finder) for your operaction and material.
- Install the tool in the proper collet or tool holder and secure it in the spindle. Tighten the drawbar securely. **Remove any wrench or spindle lock before starting the machine.**
- Estimate a suitable spindle speed for your material and tool size using the **Cutting Speeds** table and calculator below. Set the speed on the mill.
- Use the handwheels to bring the cutter close to the workpiece and carefully “touch off” to establish your zero point. Zero the DRO axes as needed.
- Plan your cut: choose a conservative depth of cut and feed. Take multiple light passes rather than one heavy pass.
- Turn on the spindle and allow it to reach full speed before feeding into the material.
- Feed smoothly using the handwheels, watching both the cutter and the DRO. Listen for chatter or overload and reduce depth of cut or feed if needed.
- For deeper cuts or slotting, periodically retract the cutter to clear chips and allow it to cool.
- When finished, retract the cutter clear of the workpiece, then turn off the spindle.
- Wait for the spindle to come to a complete stop before reaching near the cutter or workpiece.
- Remove the workpiece, deburr sharp edges, and brush/vacuum chips from the machine and floor.
- Return tooling and accessories to their proper storage and leave the mill clean for the next user.
